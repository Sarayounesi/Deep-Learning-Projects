This repository contains solutions to various machine learning and deep learning problems, including:

•  Probabilistic Models: Calculating class probabilities and classifying news headlines using learned probabilistic models.

•  Laplace Smoothing: Handling new data in test news using Laplace smoothing with an alpha coefficient of 1.

•  Logistic Regression: Modeling conditional distributions and applying maximum likelihood estimation.

•  Activation Functions: Explaining and comparing activation functions like Sigmoid, Softmax, ReLU, and Tanh.

•  MLP Design: Designing and implementing a simple MLP network to classify images, including architecture selection and justification.

•  Two-Class Classification: Using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for two-class classification and discussing potential challenges.

•  Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning: Analyzing key differences and discussing the effectiveness of deep vs. wide networks.
